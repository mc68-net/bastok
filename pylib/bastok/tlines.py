class TLines:
    ''' A sequence of tokenized BASIC lines.

        Each line has an associated decimal line number and opaque (to this
        class) tokenized data. The data are typical tokenized BASIC program
        text lines, but they may be any sequence of bytes including 0x00
        bytes).

        The sequence also has a `txttab` memory address for the start point
        used when reading or generating a "program image": the binary format
        used in ``.BAS`` save files and in memory starting at ``TXTTAB``.

        Functions:
        - `__init__()`: Create a new sequence, either empty or from a
          program image that will be passed to `parsetext()`.
        - `parsetext()`: Add lines from a program image to the list.
        - `setline()`: Add a single line to the program image.
        - `lines()`: Return the line numbers and data as a sequence
          of``(int,bytes)`` tuples.
        - `text()`: Generate a program image starting at `txttab`.
        - `write_to()`: Write a filetype byte and program image to a stream.

        Attributes:
        - `linemap`: A dictionary mapping `int` line number to the line
          data (without the terminating 0 byte).
        - `orig_text`: The original (pre-parse) text data this instance was
          instantiated with, if any (otherwise `None`). This should be the
          same as the result of `text()` if the original text was valid,
          `txttab` has not been changed from the value discovered by the
          parse, and no lines have been added, deleted or changed.

        Issues:
        - This currently assumes little-endian format, which is fine for
          8080 or 6502, but not for 6800.
        - `maxlin` defaults to 65529, which is correct for MSX-BASIC and
          GW-BASIC, but not for early 6502 BASIC (63999).

            `text` must not include the initial file type byte (usually
            0xFF) that usually starts a .BAS file.

            `txttab` must be the correct start address for the system
